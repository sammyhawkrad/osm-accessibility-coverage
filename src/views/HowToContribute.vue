        <h2>How to Help</h2>
        <p>
          The aim of our project is to increase data about the accessibility of
          places to people with disabilities. In as much as we are highlighting
          areas which have/lack this data, we also want to create an avenue to
          encourage people to contribute to the creation of the data.
          <br />
          <br />

            >OpenStreetMap</a
          >
          (OSM), where the data we are displaying comes from, is a free editable
          map of the world. Many web and mobile maps/applications use this data
          source to provide navigation information to their users. A significant
          amount of these users are people with disabilities.
          <br />
          <br />
          A person in a wheelchair may want to know if they can enter a
          building, a train station, or a restaurant with their wheelchair. Is
          there tactile paving at a place which may be useful to a blind person?
          Is there floor vibration at this stop which may help a person with
          hearing impairment. These and many more are questions people with
          disabilities ask on daily basis as they navigate our cities and towns.
          By adding these kind of information to OSM, you help make life easy
          for everyone and most expecially people with disabilities.
          <br />
          <br />
          There are so many different ways to contribute to OpenStreetMap but we
          are going to demonstrate how to do that on the most popular smart
          phone operating systems that is, Android and iOS. So if you are new to
          OpenStreetMap you can follow the guides here and start contributing
          right away.
          <br />

          how to map for people with disabilities.

          You must first create an account on OpenStreetMap:

          app finds missing map data in your vicinity and displays it on a map
          as quests. You solve each quest by visiting the location on-site and
          answering a simple question to update the map. The info you enter is
          directly added to OpenStreetMap in your name, without the need to use
          another editor.
